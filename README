>> Important Notice

This repository is still under development. Please use it at your
own risk. At least bear the following issues in mind:
1. Write and test correct 'run.sh', 'kill.sh' before you start. 
   This toolset is originally planed for my own use only. I know 
   how to make things behave as they should. You're advised to 
   read the forthcoming detailed guide document first. 
2. Anyone who are interested to try it out, please drop me a message
   first(optional). I'll note the message in the wiki page for my
   own reference. The number of users may influence how much energy 
   I spend on this project in the future. 

>> Motivation

Those toolset was developed during my course project of IERG5270/CUHK, 
Advanced Topics in P2P Network. The course project involves large amount
of simulation using PDNS. Manual configuration, run, collecting result, 
and monitoring are time consuming. Other mature distributed solutions
like Hadoop are large elephants which are not proper for only a few 
machines. Another limit is that, our department server only allocates 
5G for each postgraduate, and we don't have root privilage to set up 
all required configurations in a lower level. 

This toolset aims at:
1. Only depends on standard Linux tools: ssh, scp, perl, bash, cron. 
2. Support decouple-able applications. For communication intensive 
   applications, please turn to HPC...
3. Serve as meta tool for building your own environment. You'll find 
   functions are divided using very small granularity in this project. 
   I just want to trade some performance for flexibility.
